# Containers and Kubernetes Hackathon 

### Please make sure you're comfortable with `docker` and `kubernetes` fundamentals before starting this. If not, it's highly recommended that you complete at least some of the hands-on, prescriptive labs in [1_fundamentals](../1_fundamentals)

### Guidelines

* You're free to use the language, web framework of your choice. 
* Focus more on containerization and kubernetes aspects rather than the actual design and implementation of the app itself. You just need two components at the very least. such as:
    * A front-end webapp 
    * A backend api
    * Bonus: third component for caching or storage such as `Redis`.
* You can use the below to repos as a reference, but please make sure you're building the app, dockerfiles, kubernetes manifests from the scratch
    * https://github.com/suren-m/cndev
    * https://github.com/suren-m/cndev-config/tree/main/kustomization/base (you don't need to use kustomize. Just plain manifests to start with and bring in helm later on if time permits)
